# Party Planner Backend - 
The Party Planner App is a versatile and efficient tool designed to simplify the process of organizing and managing parties, events, and gatherings of all sizes.

### Basic infrastructure

Before we try to start the application, we should set up its basic infrastructure.
For this purpose, it is provided a [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file, which describes this basic infrastructure.
Currently, the infrastructure needed is a [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. Having [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed in your environment, you should be able to provision the resources using the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
on the other side, in order to stop these resources in your environment you should type
```sh
docker-compose stop
```
For file management we implement s3 buckets, so it is necessary to configure some environment variables:
```sh
aws.endpointUrl=${aws} aws.accessKey=${access key} aws.secretKey=${secret key}
```
> Note: In order to give access to the bucket, you will need to provide the necessary credentials. For security reasons, we are unable to supply these credentials for you.
